🛠️ How It Works
A word is randomly chosen from a predefined list.
The user guesses one letter at a time.
If the guessed letter is in the word, it is revealed in the correct position(s).
If the guess is incorrect, the hangman figure is drawn step by step.
The game ends when:
The word is guessed correctly (win 🎉)
All attempts are used up (loss 💀)
